ACCESS CONTROL;AC-1;ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]: An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance, and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls, and Reviews and updates the current: Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], and Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-2;ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: [Assignment: organization-defined information system account types], Assigns account managers for information system accounts, Establishes conditions for group and role membership, Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account, Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to create information system accounts, Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures or conditions],;Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required, or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.;AC-3,AC-4,AC-5,AC-6,AC-10,AC-17,AC-19,AC-20,AU-9,IA-2,IA-4,IA-5,IA-8,CM-5,CM-6,CM-11,MA-3,MA-4,MA-5,PL-4,SC-13

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-2 (6);DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT;P1;HIGH;The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management capabilities: [Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities].;In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic access control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for information system resiliency.;AC-16
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-2 (7);ROLE-BASED SCHEMES;P1;HIGH;The organization: Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles, Monitors privileged role assignments, and Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-2 (8);DYNAMIC ACCOUNT CREATION;P1;HIGH;The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts] dynamically.;Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing accounts (identities) at run time for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for dynamic creation of information system accounts by establishing trust relationships and mechanisms with the appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges.;AC-16

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-2 (12);ACCOUNT MONITORING / ATYPICAL USAGE;P1;HIGH;The organization: Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage], and Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].;Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems at certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of individuals working in organizations.;CA-7
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-2 (13);DISABLE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS;P1;HIGH;The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of discovery of the risk.;Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination between authorizing officials, information system administrators, and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution of this control enhancement.;PS-4
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3;ACCESS ENFORCEMENT;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information           and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.;Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, control matrices, cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, domains) in information systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information system level and recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in support of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security.;AC-2,AC-4,AC-5,AC-6,AC-16,AC-17,AC-18,AC-19,AC-20,AC-21,AC-22,AU-9,CM-5,CM-6,CM-11,MA-3,MA-4,MA-5,PE-3
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (1);RESTRICTED ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6].;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (2);DUAL AUTHORIZATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces dual authorization for [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands and/or other organization-defined actions].;Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized individuals in order to execute. Organizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and environmental safety. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control.;CP-9,MP-6
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (3);MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined mandatory access control policy] over all subjects and objects where the policy: Is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the information system, Specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the following, Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects, Granting its privileges to other subjects, Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or information system components, Choosing the security attributes and attribute values to be associated with newly created or modified objects, or Changing the rules governing access control, and Specifies that [Assignment: organization-defined subjects] may explicitly be granted [Assignment: organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects)] such that they are not limited by some or all of the above constraints.;Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained only to certain historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula Model). The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges, that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the subject.;AC-25,SC-11
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (4);DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control policy] over defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information can do one or more of the following: Pass the  information to any other subjects or objects, Grant its privileges to other subjects, Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information systemï¿½s components, Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects, or Change the rules governing access control.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (5);SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information] except during secure, non-operable system states.;Security-relevant information is any information within information systems that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security policies or maintain the isolation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Secure, non-operable system states include the times in which information systems are not performing mission/business-related processing (e.g., the system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shut down).;CM-3

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (8);REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes to the security attributes of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules governing the timing of revocations of access authorizations].;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (9);CONTROLLED RELEASE;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system does not release information outside of the established system boundary unless: The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system component] provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards], and [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the appropriateness of the information designated for release.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-3 (10);AUDITED OVERRIDE OF ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization employs an audited override of automated access control mechanisms under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].;NaN;AU-2,AU-6
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4;INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].;Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only), (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.;AC-3,AC-17,AC-19,AC-21,CM-6,CM-7,SA-8,SC-2,SC-5,SC-7,SC-18
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4 (1);OBJECT SECURITY ATTRIBUTES;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated with [Assignment: organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.;Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes associated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination objects, and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies. For example, an information object labeled Secret would be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled Secret, but an information object labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled Secret. Security attributes can also include, for example, source and destination addresses employed in traffic filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit security attributes can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of information.;AC-16

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4 (3);DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-defined policies].;Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control include, for example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions or mission/operational considerations. Changing conditions include, for example, changes in organizational risk tolerance due to changes in the immediacy of mission/business needs, changes in the threat environment, and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events.;SI-4
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4 (4);CONTENT CHECK ENCRYPTED INFORMATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by [Selection (one or more): decrypting the information, blocking the flow of the encrypted information, terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information, [Assignment: organization-defined procedure or method]].;NaN;SI-4

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4 (6);METADATA;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-defined metadata].;Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of data. Metadata can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax, and semantics) or descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone number). Enforcing allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more effective flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data), data integrity (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding of metadata to the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques with appropriate levels of assurance).;AC-16,SI-7

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4 (17);DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by [Selection (one or more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer.;Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations. The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information systems, allows the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful domain authentication requires that information system labels distinguish among systems, organizations, and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating information.;IA-2,IA-3,IA-4,IA-5
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4 (18);SECURITY ATTRIBUTE BINDING;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system binds security attributes to information using [Assignment: organization-defined binding techniques] to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.;Binding techniques implemented by information systems affect the strength of security attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations.;AC-16,SC-16

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-4 (22);ACCESS ONLY;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system provides access from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data residing on multiple different security domains, while preventing any information flow between the different security domains.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-5;SEPARATION OF DUTIES;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals], Documents separation of duties of individuals, and Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.;Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or roles, (ii) conducting information system support functions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security), and (iii) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.;AC-3,AC-6,PE-3,PE-4,PS-2
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6;LEAST PRIVILEGE;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.;Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.;AC-2,AC-3,AC-5,CM-6,CM-7,PL-2
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (1);AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information].;Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators, system security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users.;AC-17,AC-18,AC-19
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (2);NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information], use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.;This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.;PL-4
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (3);NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS;P1;HIGH;The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.;Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device).;AC-17
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (4);SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS;P1;HIGH;The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.;Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user privileges includes, for example: (i) using virtualization techniques to allow additional privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying actual machine, (ii) employing hardware and/or software domain separation mechanisms, and (iii) implementing separate physical domains.;AC-4,SC-3,SC-30,SC-32
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (5);PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].;Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged information/functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control information system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.;CM-6
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (6);PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational users.;NaN;IA-8
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (7);REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Reviews [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges assigned to [Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to validate the need for such privileges, and Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission/business needs.;The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time reflecting changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of operation, technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.;CA-7
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (8);PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software] from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-6 (9);AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.;Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (APT).;AU-2

Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined. This is typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems, for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.;AC-7

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a userï¿½s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on information system use.;SC-10,SC-23

Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for example, when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations also identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational information systems without identification and authentication and thus, the values for assignment statements can be none.;CP-2,IA-2

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-16;SECURITY ATTRIBUTES;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization:;Information is represented internally within information systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include, for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based attribute association (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements including information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include, for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects. An example of a value for both of these attribute types is Top Secret.;AC-3,AC-4,AC-6,AC-21,AU-2,AU-10,SC-16,MP-3

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-17;REMOTE ACCESS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed, and Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.;Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote, however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks.  Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control.

Prior to taking such actions, organizations can conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational information systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area.;PE-19
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-19;ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, and Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems.;A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual, (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information), (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage, and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual, however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls.

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-20;USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to: Access the information system from external information systems, and Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information systems.;External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants), (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports), (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations, and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems. For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems, and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.;AC-3,AC-17,AC-19,CA-3,PL-4,SA-9

In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external information systems contain the necessary security safeguards (i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational information systems. Verification that the required security controls have been implemented can be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.;CA-2

ACCESS CONTROL;AC-23;DATA MINING PROTECTION;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined data mining prevention and detection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined data storage objects] to adequately detect and protect against data mining.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-24;ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization establishes procedures to ensure [Assignment: organization-defined access control decisions] are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-24 (1);TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system transmits [Assignment: organization-defined access authorization information] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment: organization-defined information systems] that enforce access control decisions.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-24 (2);NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system enforces access control decisions based on [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] that do not include the identity of the user or process acting on behalf of the user.;NaN;NaN
ACCESS CONTROL;AC-25;REFERENCE MONITOR;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system implements a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization-defined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured.;Information is represented internally within information systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Reference monitors typically enforce mandatory access control policiesï¿½a type of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory because subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted from passing those privileges on to any other subjects, either directly or indirectlyï¿½that is, the information system strictly enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy.;AC-3,AC-16,SC-3,SC-39
AWARENESS AND TRAINING;AT-1;SECURITY AWARENESS AND TRAINING POLICY AND PROCEDURES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]: A security awareness and training policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance, and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security awareness and training policy and associated security awareness and training controls, and Reviews and updates the current: Security awareness and training policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], and Security awareness and training procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AT family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
AWARENESS AND TRAINING;AT-2;SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization provides basic security awareness training to information system users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors): As part of initial training for new users, When required by information system changes, and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.;Organizations determine the appropriate content of security awareness training and security awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. The content includes a basic understanding of the need for information security and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected security incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the need for operations security. Security awareness techniques can include, for example, displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security reminders, generating email advisories/notices from senior organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting information security awareness events.;AT-3,AT-4,PL-4
AWARENESS AND TRAINING;AT-2 (1);PRACTICAL EXERCISES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization includes practical exercises in security awareness training that simulate actual cyber attacks.;Practical exercises may include, for example, no-notice social engineering attempts to collect information, gain unauthorized access, or simulate the adverse impact of opening malicious email attachments or invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links.;CA-2,CA-7,CP-4,IR-3
AWARENESS AND TRAINING;AT-2 (2);INSIDER THREAT;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization includes security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.;Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction, attempts to gain access to information not required for job performance, unexplained access to financial resources, bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees, workplace violence, and other serious violations of organizational policies, procedures, directives, rules, or practices. Security awareness training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational policies and procedures.;PL-4,PM-12,PS-3,PS-6
AWARENESS AND TRAINING;AT-3;ROLE-BASED SECURITY TRAINING;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization provides role-based security training to personnel with assigned security roles and responsibilities: Before authorizing access to the information system or performing assigned duties, When required by information system changes, and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.;Organizations determine the appropriate content of security training based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific security requirements of organizations and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers, acquisition/procurement officials, information system managers, system/network administrators, personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level software, adequate security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical safeguards and countermeasures. Such training can include for example, policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the organizational security roles defined. Organizations also provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs. Role-based security training also applies to contractors providing services to federal agencies.;AT-2,AT-4,PL-4,PS-7,SA-3,SA-12,SA-16
AWARENESS AND TRAINING;AT-3 (1);ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization provides [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with initial and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] training in the employment and operation of environmental controls.;Environmental controls include, for example, fire suppression and detection devices/systems, sprinkler systems, handheld fire extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, smoke detectors, temperature/humidity, HVAC, and power within the facility.

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-2;AUDIT EVENTS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events], Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events, Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents, and Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].;An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.;AC-6,AC-17,AU-3,AU-12,MA-4,MP-2,MP-4,SI-4

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-3 (2);CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF PLANNED AUDIT RECORD CONTENT;P1;HIGH;The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in audit records generated by [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].;This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in audit records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation). Organizations coordinate the selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and configuration capability provided by the information system.;AU-6,AU-7
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-4;AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined audit record storage requirements].;Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of auditing capability.;AU-2,AU-5,AU-6,AU-7,AU-11,SI-4
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-4 (1);TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system off-loads audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto a different system or media than the system being audited.;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-5;RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system: Alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] in the event of an audit processing failure, and Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be taken (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest audit records, stop generating audit records)].;Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for different audit processing failures (e.g., by type, by location, by severity, or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.;AU-4,SI-12
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-5 (1);AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY;P1;HIGH;The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when allocated audit record storage volume reaches [Assignment: organization-defined percentage] of repository maximum audit record storage capacity.;NaN;NaN

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-5 (3);CONFIGURABLE TRAFFIC VOLUME THRESHOLDS;P1;HIGH;The information system enforces configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds reflecting limits on auditing capacity and [Selection: rejects, delays] network traffic above those thresholds.;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-5 (4);SHUTDOWN ON FAILURE;P1;HIGH;The information system invokes a [Selection: full system shutdown, partial system shutdown, degraded operational mode with limited mission/business functionality available] in the event of [Assignment: organization-defined audit failures], unless an alternate audit capability exists.;Organizations determine the types of audit failures that can trigger automatic information system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance of ensuring mission/business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of the audit failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the information system supporting the core organizational missions/business operations. In those instances, partial information system shutdowns or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may be viable alternatives.;AU-15
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6;AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Reviews and analyzes information system audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] for indications of [Assignment: organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity], and Reports findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].;Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system component inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at the information system boundaries, use of mobile code, and use of VoIP. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that include, for example, incident response team, help desk, information security group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain national security applications or systems), the review/analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority.;AC-2,AC-3,AC-6,AC-17,AT-3,AU-7,AU-16,CA-7,CM-5,CM-10,CM-11,IA-3,IA-5,IR-5,IR-6,MA-4,MP-4,PE-3,PE-6,PE-14,PE-16,RA-5,SC-7,SC-18,SC-19,SI-3,SI-4,SI-7
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (1);PROCESS INTEGRATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit review, analysis, and reporting processes to support organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious activities.;Organizational processes benefiting from integrated audit review, analysis, and reporting include, for example, incident response, continuous monitoring, contingency planning, and Inspector General audits.;AU-12,PM-7

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (3);CORRELATE AUDIT REPOSITORIES;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.;Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three tiers of risk management (i.e., organizational, mission/business process, and information system) and supports cross-organization awareness.;AU-12,IR-4
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (4);CENTRAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system provides the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from multiple components within the system.;Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include, for example, Security Information Management products.;AU-2,AU-12
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (5);INTEGRATION / SCANNING AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES;P1;HIGH;The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of [Selection (one or more): vulnerability scanning information, performance data, information system monitoring information, [Assignment: organization-defined data/information collected from other sources]] to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.;This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather, the enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of service attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations.;AU-12,IR-4,RA-5
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (6);CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING;P1;HIGH;The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (7);PERMITTED ACTIONS;P1;HIGH;The organization specifies the permitted actions for each [Selection (one or more): information system process, role, user] associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit information.;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (8);FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED COMMANDS;P1;HIGH;The organization performs a full text analysis of audited privileged commands in a physically distinct component or subsystem of the information system, or other information system that is dedicated to that analysis.;This control enhancement requires a distinct environment for the dedicated analysis of audit information related to privileged users without compromising such information on the information system where the users have elevated privileges including the capability to execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers the full text of privileged commands (i.e., commands and all parameters) as opposed to analysis that considers only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes, for example, the use of pattern matching and heuristics.;AU-3,AU-9,AU-11,AU-12
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (9);CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL SOURCES;P1;HIGH;The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to enhance organization-wide situational awareness.;Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use of organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive nature of the information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals that do not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being involved in a security incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to initiating such actions.;AT-2
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-6 (10);AUDIT LEVEL ADJUSTMENT;P1;HIGH;The organization adjusts the level of audit review, analysis, and reporting within the information system when there is a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information.;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-7;AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION;P2;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system provides an audit reduction and report generation capability that: Supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents, and Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.;Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the information system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.;AU-6
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-7 (1);AUTOMATIC PROCESSING;P2;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system provides the capability to process audit records for events of interest based on [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields within audit records].;Events of interest can be identified by the content of specific audit record fields including, for example, identities of individuals, event types, event locations, event times, event dates, system resources involved, IP addresses involved, or information objects accessed. Organizations may define audit event criteria to any degree of granularity required, for example, locations selectable by general networking location (e.g., by network or subnetwork) or selectable by specific information system component.;AU-2,AU-12
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-7 (2);AUTOMATIC SORT AND SEARCH;P2;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit records for events of interest based on the content of [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields within audit records].;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-8;TIME STAMPS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system: Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records, and Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment: organization-defined granularity of time measurement].;Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.;AU-3,AU-12
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-8 (1);SYNCHRONIZATION WITH AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system: Compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source], and Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined time period].;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-8 (2);SECONDARY AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system identifies a secondary authoritative time source that is located in a different geographic region than the primary authoritative time source.;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-9;PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system protects audit information and audit tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.;Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. This control focuses on technical protection of audit information. Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection controls and physical and environmental protection controls.;AC-3,AC-6,MP-2,MP-4,PE-2,PE-3,PE-6
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-9 (1);HARDWARE WRITE-ONCE MEDIA;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system writes audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media.;This control enhancement applies to the initial generation of audit trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the audit information to be used for detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit trails. The enhancement does not apply to the initial generation of audit records prior to being written to an audit trail. Write-once, read-many (WORM) media includes, for example, Compact Disk-Recordable (CD-R) and Digital Video Disk-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of switchable write-protection media such as on tape cartridges or Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives results in write-protected, but not write-once, media.;AU-4,AU-5
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-9 (2);AUDIT BACKUP ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS;P1;HIGH;The information system backs up audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.;This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.;AU-4,AU-5,AU-11
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-9 (3);CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION;P1;HIGH;The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools.;Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.;AU-10,SC-12,SC-13
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-9 (4);ACCESS BY SUBSET OF PRIVILEGED USERS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only [Assignment: organization-defined subset of privileged users].;Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who are also the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. This control enhancement requires that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges.;AC-5
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-9 (5);DUAL AUTHORIZATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization enforces dual authorization for [Selection (one or more): movement, deletion] of [Assignment: organization-defined audit information].;Organizations may choose different selection options for different types of audit information. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized individuals in order to execute. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control.;AC-3,MP-2
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-9 (6);READ ONLY ACCESS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization authorizes read-only access to audit information to [Assignment: organization-defined subset of privileged users].;NaN;NaN
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-10;NON-REPUDIATION;P2;HIGH;The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual) falsely denying having performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be covered by non-repudiation].;Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for example, creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by: (i) authors of not having authored particular documents, (ii) senders of not having transmitted messages, (iii) receivers of not having received messages, or (iv) signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts).;SC-12,SC-8,SC-13,SC-16,SC-17,SC-23
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-10 (1);ASSOCIATION OF IDENTITIES;P2;HIGH;The information system: Binds the identity of the information producer with the information to [Assignment: organization-defined strength of binding], and Provides the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the producer of the information.;This control enhancement supports audit requirements that provide organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in the event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of the binding between the information producer and the information based on the security category of the information and relevant risk factors.;AC-4,AC-16
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-10 (2);VALIDATE BINDING OF INFORMATION PRODUCER IDENTITY;P2;HIGH;The information system: Validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], and Performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error.;This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of cryptographic checksums.

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY;AU-10 (3);CHAIN OF CUSTODY;P2;HIGH;The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established chain of custody for all information reviewed or released.;Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each person who handled the evidence, the date and time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for the transfer. If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from the release/transfer function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer of the information to be released with the information and the information label. In the case of human reviews, this control enhancement provides organizational officials the means to identify who reviewed and released the information.

For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested particular services across organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing (e.g., the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented architectures) simply captures the identity of individuals issuing requests at the initial information system, and subsequent systems record that the requests emanated from authorized individuals.;AU-6

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION;CA-2;SECURITY ASSESSMENTS;P2;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops a security assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment including: Security controls and control enhancements under assessment, Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness, and Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities, Assesses the security controls in the information system and its environment of operation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting established security requirements, Produces a security assessment report that documents the results of the assessment, and Provides the results of the security control assessment to [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or roles].;Organizations assess security controls in organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing security authorizations, (ii) FISMA annual assessments, (iii) continuous monitoring, and (iv) system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into organizational information systems, (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process, (iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes, and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations, (ii) continuous monitoring, or (iii)   system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.;CA-5,CA-6,CA-7,PM-9,RA-5,SA-11,SA-12,SI-4

Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls employed. If interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in their respective security plans. If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the same organization, organizations can either develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the interface characteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts, especially for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private sector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices), there may be specialized connections in place during preoperational testing. Such connections may require Interconnection Security Agreements and be subject to additional security controls.;AC-3,AC-4,AC-20,AU-2,AU-12,AU-16,CA-7,IA-3,SA-9,SC-7,SI-4

SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION;CA-6;SECURITY AUTHORIZATION;P2;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the information system, Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before commencing operations, and Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed through authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or executives (i.e., authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date status of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation.  To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.;CA-2,CA-7,PM-9,PM-10
SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION;CA-7;CONTINUOUS MONITORING;P2;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes: Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined metrics] to be monitored, Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessments supporting such monitoring, Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy, Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy, Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring, Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related information, and Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of information systems.;CA-2,CA-5,CA-6,CM-3,CM-4,PM-6,PM-9,RA-5,SA-11,SA-12,SI-2,SI-4

SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION;CA-8;PENETRATION TESTING;P2;HIGH;The organization conducts penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system components].;Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an information system and can exercise both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system, (ii) pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis, and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration testing rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on the level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing.;SA-12
SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION;CA-8 (1);INDEPENDENT PENETRATION AGENT OR TEAM;P2;HIGH;The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team to perform penetration testing on the information system or system components.;Independent penetration agents or teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial penetration testing of organizational information systems. Impartiality implies that penetration agents or teams are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to the development, operation, or management of the information systems that are the targets of the penetration testing.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-2;BASELINE CONFIGURATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization develops, documents, and maintains under configuration control, a current baseline configuration of the information system.;This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems and system components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications for information systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline configurations include information about information system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices, current version numbers and patch information on operating systems and applications, and configuration settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change over time.

Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the proposed changes to the operational systems. This control enhancement requires separate configurations but not necessarily separate physical environments.;CM-4,SC-3,SC-7

Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of information systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-3 (6);CRYPTOGRAPHY MANAGEMENT;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are under configuration management.;Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key, private key, shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures in place to effectively manage those means. For example, if devices use certificates as a basis for identification and authentication, there needs to be a process in place to address the expiration of those certificates.;SC-13
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-4;SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS;P2;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation.;Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g., Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System Security Managers, and Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to understand security control requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in accordance with the security categories of the information systems.;CA-2,CA-7,CM-3,CM-9,SA-4,SA-5,SA-10,SI-2
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-4 (1);SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS;P2;HIGH;The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test environment before implementation in an operational environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.;Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment. The separation is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the operational environment, and information in the operational environment is not inadvertently transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or logical means. If physically separate test environments are not used, organizations determine the strength of mechanism required when implementing logical separation (e.g., separation achieved through virtual machines).;SA-11,SC-3,SC-7
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-4 (2);VERIFICATION OF SECURITY FUNCTIONS;P2;HIGH;The organization, after the information system is changed, checks the security functions to verify that the functions are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system.;Implementation is this context refers to installing changed code in the operational information system.;SA-11
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-5;ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system.;Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).;AC-3,AC-6,PE-3

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-5 (3);SIGNED COMPONENTS;P1;HIGH;The information system prevents the installation of [Assignment: organization-defined software and firmware components] without verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.;Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed with recognized and approved certificates include, for example, software and firmware version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input output system (BIOS) updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures, is a method of code authentication.;CM-7,SC-13,SI-7
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-5 (4);DUAL AUTHORIZATION;P1;HIGH;The organization enforces dual authorization for implementing changes to [Assignment: organization-defined information system components and system-level information].;Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that any changes to selected information system components and information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals implement such changes. The two individuals possess sufficient skills/expertise to determine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control.;AC-5,CM-3
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-5 (5);LIMIT PRODUCTION / OPERATIONAL PRIVILEGES;P1;HIGH;The organization: Limits privileges to change information system components and system-related information within a production or operational environment, and Reviews and reevaluates privileges [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;In many organizations, information systems support multiple core missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system components with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to a particular information system component may have far-reaching effects on mission/business processes supported by the system where the component resides. The complex, many-to-many relationships between systems and mission/business processes are in some cases, unknown to developers.;AC-2

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-6;CONFIGURATION SETTINGS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products employed within the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined security configuration checklists] that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements, Implements the configuration settings, Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established configuration settings for [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] based on [Assignment: organization-defined operational requirements], and Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.;Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g.,  scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings, (ii) account, file, directory permission settings, and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems.;AC-19,CM-2,CM-3,CM-7,SI-4

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.;AC-6,CM-2,RA-5,SA-5,SC-7

In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of white-listed software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.;CM-2,CM-6,CM-8,PM-5,SA-10,SC-34,SI-7
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT;CM-8;INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that: Accurately reflects the current information system, Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system, Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting, and Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective information system component accountability], and Reviews and updates the information system component inventory [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association, information system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include, for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location.;CM-2,CM-6,PM-5

Monitoring for unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms can be implemented within information systems or in other separate devices. Isolation can be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized information system components in separate domains or subnets or otherwise quarantining such components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as sandboxing.;AC-17,AC-18,AC-19,CA-7,SI-3,SI-4,SI-7,RA-5

Such plans define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans are typically developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain information system component inventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for the organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the information system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.;CM-2,CM-3,CM-4,CM-5,CM-8,SA-10

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
CONTINGENCY PLANNING;CP-2;CONTINGENCY PLAN;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops a contingency plan for the information system that: Identifies essential missions and business functions and associated contingency requirements, Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics, Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact information, Addresses maintaining essential missions and business functions despite an information system disruption, compromise, or failure, Addresses eventual, full information system restoration without deterioration of the security safeguards originally planned and implemented, and Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles], Distributes copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment: organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements], Coordinates contingency planning activities with incident handling activities, Reviews the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], Updates the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, information system, or environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution, or testing, Communicates contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements], and Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.;Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired.  Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident.;AC-14,CP-6,CP-7,CP-8,CP-9,CP-10,IR-4,IR-8,MP-2,MP-4,MP-5,PM-8,PM-11

Organizations identify critical information system assets so that additional safeguards and countermeasures can be employed (above and beyond those safeguards and countermeasures routinely implemented) to help ensure that organizational missions/business functions can continue to be conducted during contingency operations. In addition, the identification of critical information assets facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical information system assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include, for example, information technology services, information system components, information technology products, and mechanisms. Operational aspects include, for example, procedures (manually executed operations) and personnel (individuals operating technical safeguards and/or executing manual procedures).

CONTINGENCY PLANNING;CP-13;ALTERNATIVE SECURITY MECHANISMS;P0;HIGH;The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined alternative or supplemental security mechanisms] for satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] when the primary means of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised.;This control supports information system resiliency and contingency planning/continuity of operations. To ensure mission/business continuity, organizations can implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may be less effective than the primary mechanisms (e.g., not as easy to use, not as scalable, or not as secure). However, having the capability to readily employ these alternative/supplemental mechanisms enhances overall mission/business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if organizational operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative capabilities, this control would typically be applied only to critical security capabilities provided by information systems, system components, or information system services. For example, an organization may issue to senior executives and system administrators one-time pads in case multifactor tokens, the organizationï¿½s standard means for secure remote authentication, is compromised.;CP-2
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-1;IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]: An identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance, and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and associated identification and authentication controls, and Reviews and updates the current: Identification and authentication policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], and Identification and authentication procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IA family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-2;IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS);P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).;Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations deem to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers). This control applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-14, and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]), (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token), or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8.;AC-2,AC-3,AC-14,AC-17,AC-18,IA-4,IA-5,IA-8

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-2 (13);OUT-OF-BAND AUTHENTICATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band authentication] under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].;Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two separate communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system. The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify and authenticate users or devices, and generally is the path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band path) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example, a user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires access, and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the server contacts the user via the userï¿½s cell phone to verify that the requested action originated from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an individual on the telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The conditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in requested transactions.;IA-10,IA-11,SC-37

Information systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.;AC-17,AC-18,AC-19,CA-3,IA-4,IA-5

A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk (e.g., remote connections).;SC-8,SC-12,SC-13

Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information systems).

Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.;AC-2,AC-3,AC-6,CM-6,IA-2,IA-4,IA-8,PL-4,PS-5,PS-6,SC-12,SC-13,SC-17,SC-28
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-5 (1);PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system, for password-based authentication: Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type], Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: [Assignment: organization-defined number], Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords, Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum], Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations, and Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.;This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity Verification cards). The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of the requirements in the enhancement. Cryptographically-protected passwords include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords.;IA-6
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-5 (2);PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system, for PKI-based authentication: Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information, Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key, Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group, and Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the network.;Status information for certification paths includes, for example, certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, validation of certifications involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor including certificate policy processing.;IA-6
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-5 (3);IN-PERSON OR TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires that the registration process to receive [Assignment: organization-defined types of and/or specific authenticators] be conducted [Selection: in person, by a trusted third party] before [Assignment: organization-defined registration authority] with authorization by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].;NaN;NaN

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-6;AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK;P2;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.;The feedback from information systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of information systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example, displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.;PE-18
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-7;CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE AUTHENTICATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system implements mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for such authentication.;Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator is authorized to assume the requested role and perform services within that role.;SC-12,SC-13
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-8;IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS);P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).;Non-organizational users include information system users other than organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations use risk assessments to determine authentication needs and consider scalability, practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk. IA-2 addresses identification and authentication requirements for access to information systems by organizational users.;AC-2,AC-14,AC-17,AC-18,IA-2,IA-4,IA-5,MA-4,RA-3,SA-12,SC-8
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-8 (1);ACCEPTANCE OF PIV CREDENTIALS FROM OTHER AGENCIES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials from other federal agencies.;This control enhancement applies to logical access control systems (LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11 requires federal agencies to continue implementing the requirements specified in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials.;AU-2,PE-3,SA-4
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-8 (2);ACCEPTANCE OF THIRD-PARTY CREDENTIALS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials.;This control enhancement typically applies to organizational information systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. Third-party credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal government entities approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Trust Framework Solutions initiative. Approved third-party credentials meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. This allows federal government relying parties to trust such credentials at their approved assurance levels.;AU-2
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-8 (3);USE OF FICAM-APPROVED PRODUCTS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization employs only FICAM-approved information system components in [Assignment: organization-defined information systems] to accept third-party credentials.;This control enhancement typically applies to information systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. FICAM-approved information system components include, for example, information technology products and software libraries that have been approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management conformance program.;SA-4
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-8 (4);USE OF FICAM-ISSUED PROFILES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system conforms to FICAM-issued profiles.;This control enhancement addresses open identity management standards. To ensure that these standards are viable, robust, reliable, sustainable (e.g., available in commercial information technology products), and interoperable as documented, the United States Government assesses and scopes identity management standards and technology implementations against applicable federal legislation, directives, policies, and requirements.  The result is FICAM-issued implementation profiles of approved protocols (e.g., FICAM authentication protocols such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID 2.0, as well as other protocols such as the FICAM Backend Attribute Exchange).;SA-4
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-8 (5);ACCEPTANCE OF PIV-I CREDENTIALS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification-I (PIV-I) credentials.;This control enhancement: (i) applies to logical and physical access control systems, and (ii) addresses Non-Federal Issuers (NFIs) of identity cards that desire to interoperate with United States Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) information systems and that can be trusted by federal government-relying parties. The X.509 certificate policy for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) addresses PIV-I requirements. The PIV-I card is suitable for Assurance Level 4 as defined in OMB Memorandum 04-04 and NIST Special Publication 800-63, and multifactor authentication as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-116. PIV-I credentials are those credentials issued by a PIV-I provider whose PIV-I certificate policy maps to the Federal Bridge PIV-I Certificate Policy. A PIV-I provider is cross-certified (directly or through another PKI bridge) with the FBCA with policies that have been mapped and approved as meeting the requirements of the PIV-I policies defined in the FBCA certificate policy.;AU-2

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-9 (2);TRANSMISSION OF DECISIONS;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization ensures that identification and authentication decisions are transmitted between [Assignment: organization-defined services] consistent with organizational policies.;For distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions regarding the validation of identification and authentication claims may be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary to provide the identification and authentication decisions (as opposed to the actual identifiers and authenticators) to the services that need to act on those decisions.;SC-8
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-10;ADAPTIVE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires that individuals accessing the information system employ [Assignment: organization-defined supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms] under specific [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations].;Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially occur with any authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques/mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior (e.g., individuals accessing information that they do not typically access as part of their normal duties, roles, or responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals would routinely access, or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses). In these situations when certain preestablished conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require selected individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being accessed.;AU-6,SI-4
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION;IA-11;RE-AUTHENTICATION;P0;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires users and devices to re-authenticate when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations requiring re-authentication].;In addition to the re-authentication requirements associated with session locks, organizations may require re-authentication of individuals and/or devices in other situations including, for example: (i) when authenticators change, (ii), when roles change, (iii) when security categories of information systems change, (iv), when the execution of privileged functions occurs, (v) after a fixed period of time, or (vi) periodically.;AC-11
INCIDENT RESPONSE;IR-1;INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]: An incident response policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance, and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy and associated incident response controls, and Reviews and updates the current: Incident response policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], and Incident response procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].;This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9

Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems. Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related records.;AC-19,CP-9,MP-3,MP-4,RA-3,SC-8,SC-13,SC-28

Examples include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified information.;MA-2,MA-4,RA-3,SC-4

Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for example, devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices.;AC-19,PL-4

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
PLANNING;PL-2;SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops a security plan for the information system that: Is consistent with the organizationï¿½s enterprise architecture, Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system, Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions and business processes, Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting rationale, Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships with or connections to other information systems, Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system, Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable, Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements including a rationale for the tailoring decisions, and Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation, Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes to the plan to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles], Reviews the security plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments, and Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.;Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and control enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays. Security plans need not be single documents, the plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.;AC-2,AC-6,AC-14,AC-17,AC-20,CA-2,CA-3,CA-7,CM-9,CP-2,IR-8,MA-4,MA-5,MP-2,MP-4,MP-5,PL-7,PM-1,PM-7,PM-8,PM-9,PM-11,SA-5,SA-17

Organizations consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities, differentiating, for example, between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational users including, for example, individuals who simply receive data/information from federal information systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for both organizational and non-organizational users can also be established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed acknowledgment portion of this control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based security training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior.

Changes to the CONOPS are reflected in ongoing updates to the security plan, the information security architecture, and other appropriate organizational documents (e.g., security specifications for procurements/acquisitions, system development life cycle documents, and systems/security engineering documents).;PL-2
PLANNING;PL-8;INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Develops an information security architecture for the information system that: Describes the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information, Describes how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the enterprise architecture, and Describes any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external services, Reviews and updates the information security architecture [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to reflect updates in the enterprise architecture, and Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in the security plan, the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and organizational procurements/acquisitions.;This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and development of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and any other specific protection needs. In todayï¿½s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organizationï¿½s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.;CM-2,CM-6,PL-2,PM-7,SA-5,SA-17,Appendix J
PLANNING;PL-8 (1);DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth approach that: Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers], and Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and mutually reinforcing manner.;Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural, technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome multiple safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources (i.e., increases adversary work factor) and also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard does not create adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with another safeguard. Placement of security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality or information value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers, notebook computers, and workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards adversaries must penetrate before compromising the information and information systems.;SC-29,SC-36
PLANNING;PL-8 (2);SUPPLIER DIVERSITY;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] allocated to [Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers] are obtained from different suppliers.;Different information technology products have different strengths and weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to their priorities and development schedules. By having different products at different locations (e.g., server, boundary, desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect the malicious code.;SA-12

Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for information system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors. Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause.

RISK ASSESSMENT;RA-2;SECURITY CATEGORIZATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Categorizes information and the information system in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance, Documents the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security plan for the information system, and Ensures that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews and approves the security categorization decision.;Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective security categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information and information systems are comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, mission/business owners, and information owners/stewards. Organizations also consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts. Security categorization processes carried out by organizations facilitate the development of inventories of information assets, and along with CM-8, mappings to specific information system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted.;CM-8,MP-4,RA-3,SC-7
RISK ASSESSMENT;RA-3;RISK ASSESSMENT;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits, Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan, risk assessment report, [Assignment: organization-defined document]], Reviews risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], Disseminates risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles], and Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.;Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems. Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation.;RA-2,PM-9

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels, (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices, and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).;CA-2,CA-7,CM-4,CM-6,RA-2,RA-3,SA-11,SI-2

To apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components (including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects, security engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.;AT-3,PM-7,SA-8
SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-4;ACQUISITION PROCESS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization includes the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, in the acquisition contract for the information system, system component, or information system service in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs: Security functional requirements, Security strength requirements, Security assurance requirements, Security-related documentation requirements, Requirements for protecting security-related documentation, Description of the information system development environment and environment in which the system is intended to operate, and Acceptance criteria.;Information system components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an information system. Information system components include commercial information technology products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies, and (ii) evidence from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle. Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements from FISMA.;CM-6,PL-2,PS-7,SA-3,SA-5,SA-8,SA-11,SA-12

Information systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of modules with particular emphasis on software and firmware (but not excluding hardware) and the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and hardware schematics are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the information system.;SA-5

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-4 (9);FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES IN USE;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to identify early in the system development life cycle, the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.;The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design phases) allows organizations to influence the design of the information system, information system component, or information system service. This early involvement in the life cycle helps organizations to avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring information system service providers to do so). Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting of security controls after the information system, system component, or information system service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external information system services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols, and services are provided from external sources.;CM-7,SA-9

Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of security controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control system would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.;CM-6,CM-8,PL-2,PL-4,PS-2,SA-3,SA-4

Security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections, (ii) establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design, (iii) incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle, (iv) delineating physical and logical security boundaries, (v) ensuring that system developers are trained on how to build secure software, (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs, (vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors, and attack patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk, and (viii) reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.;PM-7,SA-3,SA-4,SA-17,SC-2,SC-3
SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-9;EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance, Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard  to external information system services, and Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor security control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.;External information system services are services that are implemented outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.;CA-3,IR-7,PS-7
SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-9 (1);RISK ASSESSMENTS / ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services, and Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].;Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as firewalls, or key management services.;CA-6,RA-3

Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information system, information system component, or information system service requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model, the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications, other design data, implementation documentation, source code and hardware schematics, the running version of the object code, tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with previous versions, and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.;CM-3,CM-4,CM-9,SA-12,SI-2
SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-10 (1);SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.;This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by developers.

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-11;DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to: Create and implement a security assessment plan, Perform [Selection (one or more): unit, integration, system, regression] testing/evaluation at [Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage], Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the results of the security testing/evaluation, Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process, and Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation.;Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.;CA-2,CM-4,SA-3,SA-4,SA-5,SI-2

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-12;SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION;P1;HIGH;The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system component, or information system service by employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy.;Information systems (including system components that compose those systems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design, development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain, and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems, (ii) vetting development personnel, and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system.

Organizations use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of acquisition strategies, tools, and methods. There are a number of different tools and techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of an information system or system component, using blind or filtered buys). Organizations also consider creating incentives for suppliers who: (i) implement required security safeguards, (ii) promote transparency into their organizational processes and security practices, (iii) provide additional vetting of the processes and security practices of subordinate suppliers, critical information system components, and services, (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries, and (v) provide contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In addition, organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required delivery to limit opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or products. Finally, organizations can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and warehousing options to reduce supply chain risk (e.g., requiring tamper-evident packaging of information system components during shipping and warehousing).;SA-19

Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits.  Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of operation), and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of assurance-related security controls in Appendix E). Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E-4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance solutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide), limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems, system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions. Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for organizational information systems.;RA-2,SA-4,SA-8,SA-14,SC-3
SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-14;CRITICALITY ANALYSIS;P0;HIGH;The organization identifies critical information system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, information system components, or information system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle].;Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an information system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and beyond the information system boundary. Information system components that allow for unmediated access to critical components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the organizational missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades.;CP-2,PL-2,PL-8,PM-1,SA-8,SA-12,SA-13,SA-15,SA-20

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-17;DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN;P1;HIGH;The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that: Is consistent with and supportive of the organizationï¿½s security architecture which is established within and is an integrated part of the organizationï¿½s enterprise architecture, Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security controls among physical and logical components, and Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.;This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could also be used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal developers to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such security architecture is integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction is important if/when organizations outsource the development of information systems, information system components, or information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with the organizationï¿½s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.;PL-8,PM-7,SA-3,SA-8

It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, and that any additional code or implementation details present have no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal methods can be used to show that the high-level security properties are satisfied by the formal information system description, and that the formal system description is correctly implemented by a description of some lower level, for example a hardware description. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the formal policy models is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show such consistency. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the implementation may require the use of an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability of formal methods to prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware include, for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output.;SA-5

Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for example, to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.;SA-3

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION;SA-20;CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS;P0;HIGH;The organization re-implements or custom develops [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components].;Organizations determine that certain information system components likely cannot be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation or custom development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance. This is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom develop critical information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g., enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and application files.;CP-2,SA-8,SA-14

The degree of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.;PS-3,PS-7

Unsupported components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a substantial opportunity for adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for example, systems that provide critical mission/business capability where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.;PL-2,SA-3

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION;SC-2;APPLICATION PARTITIONING;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services) from information system management functionality.;Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation of system management-related functionality from user functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different network addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. Separation of system and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls.;SA-4,SA-8,SC-3
SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION;SC-2 (1);INTERFACES FOR NON-PRIVILEGED USERS;P1;MODERATE,HIGH;The information system prevents the presentation of information system management-related functionality at an interface for non-privileged users.;This control enhancement ensures that administration options (e.g., administrator privileges) are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information). Such restrictions include, for example, not presenting administration options until users establish sessions with administrator privileges.;AC-3
SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION;SC-3;SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION;P1;HIGH;The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.;The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains). Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including, for example, through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. Information systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all of the code within the security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception.;AC-3,AC-6,SA-4,SA-5,SA-8,SA-13,SC-2,SC-7,SC-39

The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. This control does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been nominally erased or removed, (ii) covert channels (including storage and/or timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or (iii) components within information systems for which there are only single users/roles.;AC-3,AC-4,MP-6

Denial of service attacks can originate from external or internal sources. Information system resources sensitive to denial of service include, for example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Common safeguards to prevent denial of service attacks related to storage utilization and capacity include, for example, instituting disk quotas, configuring information systems to automatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using file compression technologies to maximize available storage space, and imposing separate partitions for system and user data.;CA-7,SI-4

Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.;AC-4,AC-17,CA-3,CM-7,CP-8,IR-4,RA-3,SC-5,SC-13

A proxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or services) from other organizational servers. Client requests established through an initial connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION;SC-7 (10);PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED EXFILTRATION;P1;HIGH;The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.;Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of information from information systems include, for example: (i) strict adherence to protocol formats, (ii) monitoring for beaconing from information systems, (iii) monitoring for steganography, (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly needed, (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers, and (vi) employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume/types of traffic expected within organizations or call backs to command and control centers. Devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways.

In practice, it is possible that these separate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls enforcing limited authorized access to these items.;PE-4,PE-19

Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected components. Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to more effectively control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced protection limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen.

Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by employing protected distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing encryption techniques). Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard, commercial telecommunication service packages.

SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION;SC-36 (1);POLLING TECHNIQUES;P0;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization employs polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to [Assignment: organization-defined distributed processing and storage components].;Distributed processing and/or storage may be employed to reduce opportunities for adversaries to successfully compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and information systems. However, distribution of processing and/or storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one (or more) of the distributed components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content from the various distributed components and subsequently voting on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, errors, or compromises in distributed processing and/or storage components.;SI-4

This is in contrast with using the same channels (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality, integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many organizational items including, for example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or software, cryptographic key management information, security updates, system/data backups, maintenance information, and malicious code protection updates.;AC-2,CM-3,CM-5,CM-7,IA-4,IA-5,MA-4,SC-12,SI-3,SI-4,SI-7

SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION;SC-38;OPERATIONS SECURITY;P0;MODERATE,HIGH;The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined operations security safeguards] to protect key organizational information throughout the system development life cycle.;Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of organizations by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically relates to the planning and execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves five steps: (i) identification of critical information (e.g., the security categorization process), (ii) analysis of threats, (iii) analysis of vulnerabilities, (iv) assessment of risks, and (v) the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to both organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect the confidentiality of key information including, for example, limiting the sharing of information with suppliers and potential suppliers of information system components, information technology products and services, and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information critical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses, suppliers, supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications, testing protocols, and security control implementation details.;RA-2,RA-5,SA-12
SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION;SC-39;PROCESS ISOLATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each executing process.;Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each information system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces.

Adversaries can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, or to spoof users of organizational information systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement this control.;AC-18,SC-5

These protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of determining whether the associated attachments/applications contain malicious code. While related to the concept of deception nets, the control is not intended to maintain a long-term environment in which adversaries can operate and their actions can be observed. Rather, it is intended to quickly identify malicious code and reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated to user environments of operation (or prevent such propagation completely).;SC-7,SC-25,SC-26,SC-30

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.;PM-9
SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY;SI-2;FLAW REMEDIATION;P1;LOW,MODERATE,HIGH;The organization: Identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws, Tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side effects before installation, Installs security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates, and Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process.;Organizations identify information systems affected by announced software flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates include, for example, patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and also the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Organizations may also consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures.;CA-2,CA-7,CM-3,CM-5,CM-8,MA-2,IR-4,RA-5,SA-10,SA-11,SI-11

Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by different means including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.;CM-3,MP-2,SA-4,SA-8,SA-12,SA-13,SC-7,SC-26,SC-44,SI-2,SI-4,SI-7

Unauthorized operating system commands include, for example, commands for kernel functions from information system processes that are not trusted to initiate such commands, or commands for kernel functions that are suspicious even though commands of that type are reasonable for processes to initiate. Organizations can define the malicious commands to be detected by a combination of command types, command classes, or specific instances of commands.

This capability is important for those remote information systems whose loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation would have immediate and/or serious consequences (e.g., injury or death, property damage, loss of high-valued assets or sensitive information, or failure of important missions/business functions). Authentication safeguards for remote commands help to ensure that information systems accept and execute in the order intended, only authorized commands, and that unauthorized commands are rejected.

External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet).
